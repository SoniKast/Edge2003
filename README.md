## What is this?
**Edge2003** is a Firefox CSS mod that replicates **MondySpartan**'s [Microsoft Edge in 2003 Mockup](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows_Redesign/comments/11mj5zr/microsoft_edge_in_2003_made_before_that_edge_from/) (to the best of my abilities).

It was developed on Firefox 111, so it should work on most recent versions of Firefox, unless they mess everything up (and they probably will lol).

This theme is based on the IE6 theme made for the Windows eXPerience iso, which... you can find in [**Windows eXPerience**](https://archive.org/details/windows-experience-freestyle/), go check it out! And the page is based on [Aerofox by NWinXP.](https://github.com/NWinXP/Aerofox)

## Supported operating systems
While you can use the theme on macOS or Linux, it will probably not look right. This theme was made to work with Windows 10 using a version of [BasicThemer](https://github.com/arukateru/BasicThemer5) and the [PerfectLuna10 theme](https://winclassic.boards.net/thread/1528/noir10-perfectluna10). While it has not been tested on other Windows versions, it should work as long as you have an XP-based theme.

Tested on:
- Windows 10 (Version 22h2) x64 

## Screenshots
- Windows 10 22h2 x64 with BasicThemer3, UltraUXThemePatcher and PerfectLuna10

- **Why though?**  
No particular reason, I just thought the mockup looked really cool, like an improvement over IE6's base design.

You are free to do whatever you want with this theme, it's freely available after all!
