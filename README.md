# Edge2003
Edge2003 is a Firefox CSS mod that replicates MondySpartan's Microsoft Edge in 2003 Mockup (to the best of my abilities).
It was developed on Firefox 111, so it should work on most recent versions of Firefox, unless they mess everything up (and they probably will lol).
This theme is based on the IE6 theme made for the Windows eXPerience iso, the work of travis on the WinClassic forums, go check out his amazing theme over here!

Requirements
* For back and forward icons to display properly, you must enable svg.context-properties.content.enabled in about:config. You also need to set ui.prefersReducedMotion to 1 (You may need to create it).
